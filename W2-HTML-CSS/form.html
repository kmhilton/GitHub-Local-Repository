		<h1>A Form.</h1>
		<form action="forms.html" method="post" name="myform"> <!-- target="_blank"> --> <!--where the form is getting sent to = action and the method is how it's getting there. Now a "post" (attached to an object or request) is more secure than a "get" (used to retrieve insecure data, appended to a url). An example of a get is http://www.google.com/form_submit.php?name=ben&lastname=vaughan. Example of a post is http://www.google.comform_submit.php. Now a target is where the response is going... target="_blank" is opening a new form and responding in a new blank page. target="_self" - loads in the current window (not used that often, bc it's a default) _parent - deals with frames, and it loads in the parent frame....uuugh, old and ugly.-->
			<fieldset>
			<label for="firstName">First Name</label> <!--it's good form to label your form, and it must match name on the next line-->
			<input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName"> <!--input type is hard, b/c certain inputs/types are supported by all browsers. But a name and an id are both needed.-->
			<label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
			<input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastName"> <!--name is the title of the box, and id is what is put into the box-->
			<input type="button" name="hello_button" id="hello_button" value="hello">
